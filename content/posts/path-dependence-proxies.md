# The Parable of the T-Shirt and the Trajectory

I once sat in a meeting at a venture capital firm where a partner, a man whose judgment could mint millionaires, spent ten minutes dissecting the t-shirt of a founder we had just met. It wasn't about fashion. It was about *information*. The t-shirt was from a notoriously difficult-to-get-into programming competition. The partner's thesis, elaborated with surprising earnestness, was that this t-shirt was a stronger signal of raw coding talent and grit than the founder's Ivy League computer science degree.

His argument, stripped of its Sand Hill Road mystique, was simple: the degree is a good proxy for intelligence and conscientiousness, but it's a noisy one. The t-shirt, however, was a signal so specific, so costly to obtain, that it felt like a direct glimpse into the founder's soul.

This, in a nutshell, is the epistemic problem that governs our lives. We are all, in some sense, illegible. Our true abilities, our grit, our potential—these are latent variables, hidden away in the complex machinery of our minds. To make sense of each other, society relies on a vast network of proxies and signals—degrees, job titles, accolades, even t-shirts—that attempt to render the illegible legible.

The problem is that these proxies are sticky. They accrete around us like a second skin, and the world, for reasons of cognitive efficiency, often mistakes this skin for the person beneath. This creates a powerful path dependence, an uphill gradient you have to climb if your initial set of signals doesn't match your true self. I know because I've spent a good part of my career climbing it.

## The World Is Made of Filters

Let's steel-man the case for proxies. Imagine you're a recruiter at a top tech company. You have 500 applications for a single software engineering role. You have three hours. What do you do? You can't possibly conduct a deep, holistic evaluation of every candidate. You need filters. So you create a hierarchy: MIT/Stanford/CMU grads in one pile, everyone else in another. Previous experience at a FAANG company? Pile one. Self-taught with a portfolio of hobby projects? Pile two.

This isn't necessarily because you believe a Stanford degree makes someone a 10x better engineer. It's because you believe the *probability* of finding a great engineer is higher in that pile, and your time is limited. You are, quite rationally, playing the odds. The university, the previous employer—they aren't measures of the person; they are filters designed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of your search.

The dark side of this efficiency is its persistence. The Matthew Effect—"to those who have, more will be given"—is the iron law of career trajectories. A positive signal (like an elite degree) gets you a first job at a top firm, which becomes an even stronger signal for your second job. This feedback loop compounds over time, making early advantages incredibly powerful.

Conversely, a "bad" or unconventional signal—attending a less-prestigious university, having a gap in your resume, studying the "wrong" subject—forces you onto a different path. To get back on the main track, you can't just be as good as the candidates who started there. You have to be demonstrably, overwhelmingly better to overcome the initial filter. You have to generate a signal so powerful it drowns out the noise of your non-standard background.

## A Personal Case Study in Signal Hacking

My own experience is a study in this kind of signal arbitrage. I attended Oxford, which is, objectively, a very strong signal. But I studied Classics, a degree that, in the eyes of a Silicon Valley recruiter, might as well be a degree in Ancient Etruscan Pottery.

The Oxford name got my resume looked at. But the Classics degree immediately put me in the "weird" pile. The conversation, spoken or unspoken, was always the same: "Impressive brand, but can he actually do anything useful?" The burden of proof was entirely on me.

My path involved a conscious effort to generate new, more relevant signals. I learned to code on the side, building small, sometimes-embarrassing projects. I took low-level data analysis jobs and tried to excel in ways that were visible. I was effectively laundering my signal—trading the diffuse, high-status "Oxford" brand for more specific, legible "can-do-the-work" credentials. It was an uphill climb. For every door the Oxford name opened, my degree would introduce a moment of friction, a skeptical pause that had to be overcome with a portfolio, a technical test, or a torrent of jargon-filled enthusiasm.

## Venture Capital and the Search for Latent Variables

The VC world is where this dynamic plays out with the highest stakes. When you're investing in two founders with a PowerPoint, you have no revenue, no product-market fit, no data. All you have are proxies.

What I saw in VC was an almost mystical obsession with divining a founder's "latent ability"—that ineffable g-factor of getting things done. We would sit in partner meetings and debate the meaning of signals. Did the founder's time at Google matter more than their side project that got 10,000 users? Was their calm demeanor a sign of quiet confidence or a lack of urgency?

This is where you see the reverence for founders like Travis Kalanick or Adam Neumann. They weren't just impressive on paper. They projected a signal of raw, world-bending force that went beyond their resumes. Kalanick's infamous aggressiveness, Neumann's messianic charisma—these were powerful (and, as it turned out, dangerous) manifestations of a perceived latent ability. Investors weren't just betting on a business model; they were betting on a person's capacity to bend reality to their will.

The venture capitalist's job is to believe they can see this latent space more clearly than anyone else. They believe their filters—their network, their intuition, their pattern-matching—are better calibrated to find the true signal amidst the noise of credentials. But this, too, is a world of proxies, just more esoteric ones. The VC is still looking at the t-shirt, just a different, more expensive t-shirt.

## Are We Doomed To Live In The Matrix of Proxies?

So if the world runs on these sticky, often-arbitrary signals, what can we do?

First, we can acknowledge the reality of the system. Pretending that only pure merit matters is a comforting fiction. The gradient is real. Understanding what signals are valued in your chosen field is a crucial first step in navigating it.

Second, we can become better signal generators. If your initial proxies are weak, you must consciously build new ones. This is the logic of the portfolio, the side project, the open-source contribution. These are attempts to create legible evidence of your illegible talents.

But there's a more profound question here. Is this system of proxies just a necessary evil, a flawed but efficient way to sort talent in a complex world? Or is it something more insidious, a mechanism for perpetuating existing hierarchies?

I suspect it's both. The world is too complex for holistic evaluation at scale. We will always need proxies. But we can become more sophisticated consumers of them. We can learn to question our own reliance on credentials, to look for the person who took the harder path, to update our beliefs when new evidence emerges.

Ultimately, our trajectory is a combination of the signals we're given and the signals we create. We are not just the sum of our proxies, but also the stories we tell about them—and, if we're persistent enough, the work we do to transcend them. It is a difficult, sometimes unfair game. But it is, for better or worse, the only game in town.
