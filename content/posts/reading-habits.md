# Reading Habits

Building consistent reading habits has become more challenging in our hyper-connected world. Here are a few strategies that have worked for me:

## Start Small

Instead of ambitious goals like "read 50 books this year," focus on reading for just 15 minutes daily. Consistency matters more than volume.

## Physical Books

Despite the convenience of digital reading, physical books offer fewer distractions. No notifications, no temptation to switch apps.

## Note-Taking

Keep a simple notebook nearby while reading. Jotting down thoughts and interesting passages helps with retention and engagement.

## Reading Time

Protect your reading time like any other important appointment. Morning reading, before the day's demands take over, works particularly well.

The goal isn't to become a speed reader or to consume as much as possible. The goal is to think deeply about what you're reading and to let it change how you see the world.
